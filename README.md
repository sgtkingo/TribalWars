# TribalWars Toolkit Scripts
Welcome to the repository of my private project **TribalWars Toolkit**! This is a set of scripts designed to make your life easier in TribalWars - in other words, they are *mini-bots*!

## Tampermonkey
These scripts are primarily created for the Tampermonkey scripter (recommended). 
You can add Tampermonkey extension to your browser: [https://www.tampermonkey.net/](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

*For proper functioning, enable "Developer mode" for the extension.*

## Scripts

- ### Gatherer
This script takes care of advanced automatic material collection. The script can be easily configured to change the collection period, collection strategy and collection tiers. 
The script automatically detects army status. 

**Limitations:**
  - Game language sensitivity (currently only for Czech (cs) servers)
  - Only for one village in the time

**Planned improvements:**
  - Independence on language
  - Multi-village system

- ### Plunderer
This script automatically sends units through the Looting Helper, allows you to configure the sending period, strategy (day/night) and minimum reserves of units in the village.  
The script automatically detects templetes config and army status. 

**Limitations:**
  - Only for one village in the time

**Planned improvements:**
  - Multi-village system

---
*All scripts emulate human behavior (keyboard input, random pauses and intervals, page reload...), so they should be invisible to bot detectors.*

**Use scripts at your own risk!**
